# Group 3 – AI in Employment

Course: MAIB AI 219 – Ethics, Sociology, and Governance of AI  
Case framing: AI in Employment (HireVue-style screening risks)

Inputs:
- Perplexity.md → authoritative research context
- dataset_instructions/ → allowed datasets and loading methods

Dataset selection rule:
1. Try FairJob (HuggingFace: criteo/FairJob)
2. If unavailable, use UCI Adult (ucimlrepo id=2)
3. Synthetic data ONLY if both fail, with justification

Goal:
Conduct an explainability-first algorithmic audit
(fairness, bias, governance — not accuracy optimization).
